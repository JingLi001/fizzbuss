# fizzbuss

Fizzbuss is an interesting table game. 

The concept behind FizzBuzz is as follows:

1. Write a program that prints the numbers 1-100, each on a new line
2. For each number that is a multiple of 3, print “Fizz” instead of the number
3. For each number that is a multiple of 5, print “Buzz” instead of the number
4. For each number that is a multiple of 15, print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8.5* and scikit-learn version 0.24.1.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Titanic survivors data to better understand:

1. How to look at the data?
2. How to deal with the missing values and how to choose the proper impute methods based on the given data set?
3. In general, do sex appear to have higher survived possibility?
4. How many of the columns are considered categorical? How to handle them?
5. How to build the model for predicting the survived possiblity?
6. How to modify the parameteres to get a higher accuracy?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All the project code is contained in a Jupyter notebook, which demonstrates successful execution and output of the code. Given the criteria, There are 3 files available here to showcase work related to the above questions: the csv files of 'Titanic survivors data', the jupyter notebook inclusive of the whole code, a readme file.  Markdown cells and explanatory note were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jingli11.medium.com/how-to-start-being-a-data-scientist-735c9c2f5e1).
